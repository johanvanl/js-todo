JS-TODO
=======

A TODO list in JavaScript, which can be used [HERE](http://johanvanl.github.io/js-todo/).

The TODO list is stored locally, and will thus still be there when you come back.

Got the idea from [imLinder](https://github.com/imLinder/1kB-todo-list), I made my own version as a learning experience.
